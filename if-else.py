# Python If-Else

# Task
# Given an integer, n, perform the following conditional actions:
# If n is odd, print Weird
# If n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print Not Weird
# If n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print Weird
# If n is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird

# Input Format
# A single line containing a positive integer, n.

# Constraints
# 1 <= n <= 100

# Output Format
# Print Weird if the number is weird; otherwise, print Not Weird.

n = int(input().strip())

if n % 2 == 1:
    print("Weird")
elif n % 2 == 0:
    if n >= 2 and n <= 5:
        print("Not Weird")
    elif n >= 6 and n <= 20:
        print("Weird")
    elif n > 20:
        print ("Not Weird")
